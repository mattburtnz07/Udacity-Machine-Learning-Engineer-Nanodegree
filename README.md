# Udacity-Machine-Learning-Engineer-Nanodegree
This repo holds my coursework from the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. This course covers machine learning from data exploration to model deployment with a focus on using AWS.

# Content

1 - Creating a Sentiment Analysis Web App  
This project involved training a LSTM Classifier in AWS's Sagemaker to train a sentiment analysis model. Steps included data processing in Jupyter, model trianing and deployment using Sagemaker and creating a web application to use the deployed model.  

2a - Moon Data Project	Revised commit  
This project involved building a custom neural network binary classification model in Sagemaker, training and deploying the model and testing its accuracy.  

2b - Fraud Detection	Revised commit  
This project involved a supervised learning task of detecting fraudulent transactions. This was done by training a Linear Learner classification modle in Sagemaker and eveluating the results. Other tasks included data exploration and preparation of a test/train dataset.  

2c - Population Segmentation  
This project involved data exploration and preparation including training a Principal Component Analysis model for dimensionality reduction, feature engineering and data transformation. Cleaned data was then used to train a kmeans clustering model. Seaborn was used to visualise model clusters.  

2d - Time Series Forecasting  
This project involved performing time series analysis on global household electric power consumption data using SageMaker's supervised learning model, DeepAR. Tasks included data exploration and visualisation, creating training and test sets, formatting JSON files and uploading to S3, creating and training a DeepAR time series estimator, deploying and evaluating a trained model including using visualisations.  

2e - Plagiarism Project  
This project was the final one of the course prior to the capstone. It involved training and dpeloying a plagiarism detection model using Amazon Sagemaker on computer science short answer questions. I chose to use a custom PyTorch neural network model in my project and the model ended up predicting the correct class for 100% of the test data. Other tasks included natural language processing, feature engineering and transformation, using SKLearns CountVectorizer and using feature correlation to select best features for model training.
