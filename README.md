This repo holds my coursework from the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. This course covers machine learning from data exploration to model deployment with a focus on using AWS.

# Content

1 - Creating a Sentiment Analysis Web App  
This project involved training a LSTM Classifier in AWS's Sagemaker to train a sentiment analysis model. Steps included data processing in Jupyter, model trianing and deployment using Sagemaker and creating a web application to use the deployed model.  

2a - Moon Data Project	Revised commit  
This project involved building a custom neural network binary classification model in Sagemaker, training and deploying the model and testing its accuracy.  

2b - Fraud Detection	Revised commit  
This project involved a supervised learning task of detecting fraudulent transactions. This was done by training a Linear Learner classification modle in Sagemaker and eveluating the results. Other tasks included data exploration and preparation of a test/train dataset.  

2c - Population Segmentation  
This project involved data exploration and preparation including training a Principal Component Analysis model for dimensionality reduction, feature engineering and data transformation. Cleaned data was then used to train a kmeans clustering model. Seaborn was used to visualise model clusters.  

2d - Time Series Forecasting  


2e - Plagiarism Project
